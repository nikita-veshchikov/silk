This is the code of SILK: Simple Leakage Simulator

SILK simulator was developed for comparative analysis
from the point of view of side-channel attacks.
SILK can not be used to detect all problems in specific implementations,
its main purpose is to compare high-level of abstraction implementations.

The simulator is described in the paper presented in 2014 in New Orlean
at PPREW-4:
